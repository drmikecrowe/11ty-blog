			"I'm a Principal Consultant for Pinnacle Solutions Group.  Over my 30+ years in the industry, I have worked on everything from tiny embedded microcontrollers to terrabyte big-data projects.",
			"This is my place to collect my thoughts, write down things I've learned, and sometimes think out loud.  It's an archive of a personal journey, so don't judge me too hard.",
			"For example, my Wordle blog post is from some time ago -- I'm not a fan of back-filling a blog, but I was particularly satisfied with that project.  I have another one coming in the works about Farkle (the dice game).  I'm exited to do something similar to that."
